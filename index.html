            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night.</p>

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and
                    wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there
                    is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.</p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, “Move
                    from here to there,” and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.

                <p>It’s first important to be compassionate to yourself. Self-compassion helps you to better handle
                    life’s difficulties. Secondly, practicing compassion towards others helps us to be more helpful to
                    people. Knowing that everyone is going through something can help you be less quick to be angry.

            <p>Limits of development are the observance of limitations of ecological, economical , and social
                developments in order to avoid emergencies to human beings in a global or regional sense. The PMP
                considers that sustainability is also an important part of its concern.</p>

            <p>Among all the creatures on Earth, the human being is definitely superior. Writing a few lines or words
                about myself to introduce, I feel myself to be a tiny part of this entire world that is filled with the
                human beings around. I am a human. I myself am humble, kind, caring, and courageous. I am most
                respected, loved and responsible human being. Though, it is quite hard to write about yourself yet I
                have tried myself best to express all about myself.</p>
